1.         What personally identifiable information is collected from me?

 

On some Thread Web pages you can make requests and/or receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are your name, e-mail address, and standard contact information, including addresses and phone numbers.

We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with the services we provide, and/or contact preferences. Wherever Thread collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

 

2.         What are cookies and how are they used by Thread?

 

Thread may place Internet cookies on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are used to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service; (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target our services based on user interests and behavior; (c) track your progress and entries in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests, if any; and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users’ habits are similar or different from one another. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, some Web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.

 

Thread may also collect IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting, and how much time they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you.

 

3.         How is my information used?

 

Thread will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others without your consent. The information you provide will be used to support your relationship with Thread. Your information may be shared with Thread’s agents, contractors, or business partners for the purpose of performing services for Thread.

 

We want to help you quickly find information on Thread and alert you to specific opportunities, updated information, and services from Thread. Accordingly, we, if you agree, may send you direct mailings or contact you by telephone about our various services or other opportunities for collaboration we feel may be of interest to you. If you want to receive such mailings, simply “opt-in” by contacting info@thread.org.

 

Notwithstanding, Thread does research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us during your use of the Thread Web site. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information. Thread may share this aggregated data with others.

 

4.         Who is collecting my information?

 

When you are on a Thread site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Thread alone, unless specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Thread or an agent for Thread, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you want your data to be shared, you can choose to allow the transfer by “opting-in” to use that particular service or purchase those particular goods.

 

Please be aware that Thread advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to Thread either through advertisements or other hyperlinks are not covered by this privacy statement.

 

5.         With whom does Thread share my information?

 

We may share the personal data you provide with other Thread agents, contractors, or our business partners for the purposes of performing services for Thread. Thread also may share aggregated data with others. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable information. We also believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the Terms and Conditions, or as otherwise required by law. Except as provided above or in the event of a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of Thread’s assets, we will not share any of your information with any third party without your permission.

 

6.         How do I access, update, or delete my information?

 

You can request the individual information that Thread has collected about you, correct factual inaccuracies in your information, remove personal information from Thread’s databases and/or update your personal information at 410-660-8343 or by contacting info@Thread.org.

 

7.         What does “opt-in” mean?

 

To “opt-in” means that you have notified Thread that we have permission to use your information for a particular enumerated purpose(s). Of course, when we send you information on an opportunity or service for which you have “opted-in,” you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving such information in the future.

 

8.         What else should I know about my privacy?

 

Third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Thread have separate privacy and data-collection practices, independent of us. Thread has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, Thread cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission process and you do so at your own risk.

 

            9.         Other Legal Notices.

            Any dispute over privacy is subject to this privacy policy and our Terms and Conditions, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the State of Maryland. If you have any concern about your privacy in connection with this policy, please send us a thorough description to info@thread.org, and we will try to resolve it. We may post a revised privacy policy on our site. Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the privacy notice in effect at the time of use. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.
