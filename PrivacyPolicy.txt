* Our Privacy Policy describes the categories of personal information that you may provide when you download, install, register with, access, or use the Thread mobile application (the “App”), or that may be collected through the App by Thread or on our behalf.   

* Our Privacy Policy also explains how we and some of the companies we work with use, share, and protect your personal information in relation to the App, and your choices about the collection and use of such information.  


This Privacy Policy applies to all users who access the App (“Users”), but it only governs personal information that is collected in this App and in any text or other electronic communications sent through this App.  It does not apply to personal information that we collect offline or on any other Thread websites, including websites you may access through this App, or that you provide to or is collected by any third party outside of this App.  Our websites and these other third parties have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to read before providing your information on or through them.


This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use (“Terms”), available at Thread.org/privacy-policy/.  This Privacy Policy may also change from time to time.  Your continued use of this App after we revise this policy means you accept those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.  


Our App is not intended for children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen (13).  If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under thirteen (13) without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.  If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under thirteen (13), please contact us at support@thread.org.

6.        How do we store your data?


We and Thrive may retain information collected from you for any period permitted or required under applicable laws, whether in deidentified format or not.  Even if we or Thrive delete your information, it may persist on backup or archival media for an additional period of time due to technical issues or for legal or regulatory reasons or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.


We and Thrive have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.  We ask you not to share your password with anyone.  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure.  Although we and Thrive will do our best to protect your personal information, we and Thrive cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our App.  Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.  We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.


7.       What Are My Choices About Your Collection, Use, and Disclosure of My 
Information?


We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.  This section describes mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of over your information.


* Opting In.  To “opt-in” means that you have notified Thread that we have permission to use your information for a particular enumerated purpose(s).  Of course, when we send you information on an opportunity or service for which you have “opted-in,” you will be given the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving such information in the future. 


* Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising and Marketing.  We will NOT share information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for advertising and marketing purposes.  


8.         What else should you know about your privacy?


Third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Thread have separate privacy and data-collection practices, independent of us.  Thread has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.  Please be careful and responsible online.  


If you post User Content or any personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  While we strive to protect your information, Thread cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission process and you do so at your own risk.  Additionally, we cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content.  Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
